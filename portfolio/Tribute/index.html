            "There is no one in the world like your granma and grandfather. They are your blood, your lineage, and sometimes they are the person who you hold
            nearest and dearest. Grandparents add so much color and vibrance to life, and theywon't be around forever. Make sure that you tell them how loved and
            appreciated they are while they are still with you here on earth."
