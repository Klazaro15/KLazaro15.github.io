          <p>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language commonly used for web development to enhance HTML pages. It enables the creation of interactive web applications by adding dynamic 
            behavior to static web pages. JavaScript is supported by most web browsers and allos for the manipulation of HTML elements, 
            handling user interactions and making asynchronous requests to servers.

          CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. 
          CSS is used to define the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a webpage, allowing 
          for the separation of the presentation from the content. This separation makes it easier to maintainin
          and update the appearance of a website, as changes to the style sheet will be applied to all pages that reference it. 
          CSS is a key technology for creating modern, dynamic, and responsive websites that can adapt to different
          screen sizes and devices.

            The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary 
            executables natively on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019. It allows developers to run their favorite Linux tools, 
            such as bash, ssh, git, apt, emacs, and vim, directly on Windows, without the need for a virtual machine or dual-boot setup.
             WSL is designed to provide a seamless experience for Linux users, with features such as file system integration, network transparency, 
             and support for Linux-specific tools and utilities. It is available as a feature in Windows 10, and can be enabled 
             and configured through the Windows Control Panel or the Windows Subsystem for Linux Setup application. WSL supports 
             multiple Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Debian, and Kali Linux, and allows users to choose the one that best fits 
             their needs and preferences. WSL is a powerful tool for developers who need to use Linux tools and utilities on Windows, 
             and is a popular choice for web development, data science, machine learning, and other fields that rely on Linux technologies
